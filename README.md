## Project Overview

Derme is a mobile application designed to help users with sensitive skin and allergies analyze ingredients in cosmetic products. By scanning products, users can identify potential allergens, track skin reactions, and receive personalized recommendations.

---

## Problem Statement

Consumers with sensitive skin and allergies face a significant challenge in identifying potential irritants within the complex ingredient lists of cosmetic and skincare products. This difficulty creates a barrier for individuals wishing to safely purchase new products and makes it hard to provide accurate information to dermatologists when trying to diagnose the source of an adverse reaction.

The process of tracking ingredients, cross-referencing them with known allergens, and correlating them to specific skin reactions is manually intensive and often unreliable. This leaves users feeling frustrated and disempowered, turning the proactive management of their skin health into a constant struggle. Derme aims to solve this by providing a centralized, intelligent platform to simplify ingredient analysis and allergy management.

[ ] Ensure the Demo link to Hugging Face Spaces is active and up-to-date.
## Core System Goals

Our goal is to build a system that can:
* **Scan Products:** Allow users to scan product barcodes or upload images of ingredient labels.
* **Analyze Ingredients:** Cross-reference ingredients against a known allergen database and a user's personal allergy list.
* **Track Symptoms:** Provide a journal for users to log skin reactions and connect them to specific products.
* **Provide Alerts:** Notify users about potential flare-ups based on environmental data (pollen, air quality).
* **Offer Emergency Support:** Integrate features to contact emergency services and share allergy information.
